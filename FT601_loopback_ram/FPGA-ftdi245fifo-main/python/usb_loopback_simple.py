# This program is a test of FPGA+FTDI USB chips (FT232H, FT600, or FT601)
# It sends 16 bytes to FTDI chip. The FPGA immediately returns these data (loopback).
# The program will receive these bytes (they should be as same as the sended 16 bytes)
#
# The corresponding FPGA top-level design can be found in fpga_top_ft232h_loopback.v (if you are using FT232H or FT2232H chips)
#                                                   Or see fpga_top_ft600_loopback.v (if you are using an FT600 chip)
